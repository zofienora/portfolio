                <h1>I'm Sophie Nora. and I’m on an exciting journey to become a full-fledged Frontend Developer.</h1>
                <p>My path to coding began in an unexpected way: while studying Cultural Science, I took a course in Python and discovered a passion for programming that I hadn’t anticipated.<br><br> That initial spark stayed with me and grew over time, especially as I realized that my current job wasn’t fulfilling all of my aspirations. It was then that I made the decision to turn this passion into a career.
                    Now, as I dive deeper into the world of frontend development, I’m embracing every opportunity to learn and create. I may be at the beginning of this new chapter, but my enthusiasm is boundless. I love bringing web designs to life, particularly with the help of CSS animations and the versatile power of JavaScript.<br><br> I’m committed to making sites not only visually appealing but also accessible, ensuring that the web is an inclusive space for everyone.
                    Outside of coding, you’ll often find me soaking up the unique atmosphere of airports—there’s just something about the anticipation and energy of people on the move. I’m also an avid swimmer, finding peace and joy in the water, and I have a special fondness for my favorite snack: artichokes.
                    <br><br>This is just the beginning of my career switch, and I’m excited for the journey ahead. Welcome to my digital space—I’m glad you’re here to be part of it!
